  <p class="quote">"Programming is a craft. At its simplest, it comes down to getting a
  computer to do what you want it to do (or what your user wants it to do). As
  a programmer, you are part listener, part advisor, part interpreter, and
  part dictator. You try to capture elusive requirements and find a way of
  expressing them so that a mere machine can do them justice. You try to
  document your work so that others can understand it, and you try to
  engineer your work so that others can build on it. What's more, you try to do
  all this against the relentless ticking of the project clock. You work small
  miracles every day." -Andy Hunt, The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master </p>
