  <p class="summary">My name is Jason Dinh and I am a fresh graduate from UC Davis with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering.
     I have a passion for learning all things technology. Specifically, I have been interested in IoT tech and machine learning and have taken
     on some personal projects that you can view on this website.
  </p>

  <br>

  <p>But in my free time away from the whirlwind that is the tech industry, I can probably be found reading sci-fi classics, PR-ing (trying to at least) at the
     gym, studying chess theories, or playing videogames with friends. Feel free to contact me at jhdinh@ucdavis.edu for any kind of inquiry.
