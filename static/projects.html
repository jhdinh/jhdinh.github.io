  <h1>AWS Battleship (March 2018 - April 2018)</h1>

  <p>My AWS Battleship project was the final assignemnt for my Embedded Systems class and tested my knowledge in networking and hardware.
     This open-ended project required me and my parter to use two Texas Instrument CC3200 Launchpads to communicate to one another through Amazon
     Web Services and Amazon's RESTful API. We decided that a turn-based game would work best with the RESTful API's HTTP POST and GET methods and
     eventually settled on Battlehip. The hardware used were IR remotes to control the players' pieces, OLED screens to display the game, and a
     wifi adapter calibrated to connect to the local wifi. The C code that communicated with the hardware, would sense input from the IR remote
     during a players turn and send a POST request once they hide all of thier ships or select a space to fire on. The waiting player would
     constantly be sending GET requests to the AWS server until the POST request comes through. Once the POST request is recieved by the waiting
     player, the roles are switched and the game continues until one player sinks all of the other player's battleships.

  <h1>CS Articulation Website (January 2018 - June 2018)</h1>

  <p>The CS Articulation Website was the final assignment for my two-quarter-long senior design project. As a group of four, this project required
    my teammates a I to create a website that would function as the UC Davis Computer Science Department's hub for submitting and tracking transfer
    students' units. In summary, incoming UC Davis students would submit articulations for classes from their previous university (along with a syllabus
    and class material) and professors teaching equivalent classes at UC Davis would determine whether or not students should recieve units for that course.
    The website is set to be deployed during Fall 2018.
